# Welcome to my clicker game

It's a really small, simple game I made because I was bored one afternoon.

## How do I play?

Something something get java, on the terminal type 
```javac Finestra.java``` 
```javac Main.java```
(you only need to do it once), then 
```java Main```
when you want to play :)

## What are the rules?

There's only one rule: don't be *too* greedy!
~~Actually there are two, you have to be at least a little bit greedy.~~
Have fun changing the value of your total, making it go up by one, down by one or make it fly up adding 99!

## Can I actually win tho?

Yes :)
It's simply way easier to lose.

There are three "ending" conditions and just a few rules, try to find them out by playing.

# Thank you for trying out my game!
It means a lot :)
